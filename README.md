# Close
[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/close.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/close/)

The unofficial ASP.NET Core API client for [Close](https://close.com), supporting .net Core 6+

This is _not_ an official project by Close. It's created and maintained by [Telzio](https://telzio.com), because the API client [mentioned](https://developer.close.com/topics/api-clients/#c) in Close' docs hasn't been updated in 7+ years.
